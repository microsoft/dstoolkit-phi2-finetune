Question,Answer
What is the difference between Office 2021 (one-time purchase) and Microsoft 365 (subscription)?,"Office 2021 is sold as a one-time purchase, which means you pay a single, up-front cost to get Office apps for one computer. One-time purchases are available for both PCs and Macs. However, there are no upgrade options, which means if you plan to upgrade to the next major release, you'll have to buy it at full price. \n\nMicrosoft 365 is a subscription that includes the most collaborative, up-to-date features in one seamless, integrated experience. Microsoft 365 includes the robust Office desktop apps that you’re familiar with, like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. You also get extra online storage and cloud-connected features that let you collaborate on files in real time. With a subscription, you'll always have the latest features, fixes, and security updates along with ongoing tech support at no extra cost. You can choose to pay for your subscription on a monthly or yearly basis, and the Microsoft 365 Family plan lets you share your subscription with your family for up to 6 people, and use your apps on multiple PCs, Macs, tablets, and phones."
How do I know if my PC or Mac can run Microsoft 365?,"Microsoft 365 is compatible with PC, Mac, Android, and iOS. See [system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources) for compatible versions of your devices, and for other feature requirements."
Will Microsoft 365 be identical on a PC and a Mac?,"No. Apps are tailored to work best on each operating system. The apps available for Mac users and the specific features included may be different from those available for PC users. With Microsoft 365, you can be flexible. With your account, you are not limited to exclusively Mac or exclusively PC, so you can transition across device."
Do I keep control of my documents with a Microsoft 365 subscription?,Yes. Documents that you have created belong fully to you. You can choose to store them online on OneDrive or locally on your PC or Mac.
Is Internet access required for Microsoft 365?,"Internet access is required to install and activate all the latest releases of apps and services included in all Microsoft 365 subscription plans. Note that if you are an existing subscriber, you do not need to reinstall or purchase another subscription.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 plans, Internet access is also needed to manage your subscription account, for example to install apps on other PCs or to change billing options. Internet access is also required to access documents stored on OneDrive, unless you install the  OneDrive desktop app . \n\nYou should also connect to the Internet regularly to keep your version of Microsoft 365 up to date and to benefit from automatic upgrades. If you do not connect to the internet at least every 31 days, your apps will go into reduced functionality mode, which means that you can view or print your documents but cannot edit the documents or create new ones. To reactivate your apps, simply reconnect to the Internet.\n\nYou do not need to be connected to the Internet to use Office apps such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, because the apps are fully installed on your computer."
"What is a Microsoft account, and why do I need it for Microsoft 365?","Your Microsoft account is the combination of an email address and password that you use to sign in to services like OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, and Outlook.com. If you use any of these services, you already have a Microsoft account that you can use, or you can create a new account. [Learn more about a Microsoft account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403717).\n\nAs part of signing up for a trial or purchasing Microsoft 365, you will be prompted to sign in with a Microsoft account. You must be signed in with this account to install and manage your Microsoft 365 subscription, or to use some subscription benefits, including OneDrive storage."
How many people can use a Microsoft 365 subscription?,"You can share Microsoft 365 Family with five other people, for a total of six users. Microsoft 365 Personal can be used by one person."
How do I share my subscription benefits with other people?,"If you have an active Microsoft 365 Family subscription, you can share it with up to five other people. Each person you share your subscription with can install Microsoft 365 on all their devices and sign in to five devices at the same time.\n\nTo add someone to your subscription, visit [account.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=867985) and follow the on-screen instructions to add a user.

When the trial ends, you’ll be prompted to choose which Microsoft 365 plan you want to purchase."
What happens when my trial ends?,"It depends on how you signed up for the trial: \n If you signed up via the  Microsoft 365 website , and if recurring billing is enabled on the  Microsoft Account  site, your service will continue uninterrupted and your payment method will be automatically charged at the end of the trial, and then monthly thereafter. You do not need to re-install Office apps. If you signed up by clicking an icon on your new PC, your trial ends automatically after a month; it isn’t necessary to cancel it.

Should I use my existing Microsoft account or create a new one?,"It's best to use your existing Microsoft account.

If you forgot your username or password, recover those details by returning to sign in and clicking on Can't access your account?"
What happens if I buy or redeem multiple Microsoft 365 subscriptions?,"Your Microsoft account can have only one subscription associated with it.

Your billing settings are shown on the  Microsoft Account site  after you sign in with the Microsoft account that you used to buy Microsoft 365. \n\nIf recurring billing is not enabled, visit [microsoft365.com/renew](http://www.microsoft365.com/renew) to purchase a Microsoft 365 recurring billing subscription. The additional time will be automatically added to the remaining time on your existing subscription."
Will I keep my remaining subscription time if I pay early?,"Yes. When you pay early to the same Microsoft 365 plan that you already have, the additional time is added to your existing subscription. For example, if you have two months left on your current subscription to Microsoft 365 Family and you pay for a one-year subscription (12 months), your subscription will run for 14 more months."
How do I cancel my Microsoft 365 recurring billing subscription?,"If you purchased a recurring billing subscription from Microsoft via MicrosoftStore.com or microsoft365.com, you have two options for cancelling:\nYou can cancel online by visiting the [Microsoft Account site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=831178), signing in with the Microsoft account that you used to buy your subscription, and then turning off recurring billing. With this approach, your subscription will automatically expire when your remaining subscription time is up.\n\nTo cancel immediately, contact Microsoft support and request an immediate cancellation.\n\nIf you purchased a recurring billing subscription from another retailer, you may have to cancel your subscription with that retailer. You can confirm this by visiting the [Microsoft Account site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=831178)."
